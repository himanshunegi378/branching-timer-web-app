## What is it?

A countdown timer app but here timer can be chained and you can create as many countdown Timers as you want.

## What's the big picture?

Suppose you are working on your task using pomodoro. You are so into it that you forget to drink water well worry not create a timer that will run every 15 minute to remind you. In short put everything you want to be reminded but can't be bothered with remembering it just put it in the app.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Future plans`

* add support for custome voice recorded reminder. why you ask? Imagine your pomodoro short break ended and you hear a timer end beep but you don't get back to work now imaging short break ends and you hear you own voice telling you to get back to work even if you are doing something interesting that is not related to current task. I feel that would be much more motivating to get back to work.
